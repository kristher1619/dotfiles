* ChocTop no longer solely for Cocoa applications
* Applications shortcut only included if the primary target is a .app bundle
* Creates a non-versioned symlink to latest released DMG
* Files to be included can be specified by relative path, method helper (as a symbol) or a proc that returns a string path. 
  Examples:
    file 'build/Release/SampleApp.app', :position => [50, 100]
    file :target_bundle, :position => [50, 100]
    file proc { 'README.txt' }, :position => [50, 100]
    file :position => [50, 100] { 'README.txt' }
