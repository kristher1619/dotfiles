== Modifications by billymeltdown:

Just some real basic stuff for our internal use here at Zetetic. I'd ignore the :scp business, 
in the end it turned out to be whack, but I'll preserve it here in case anyone really needs it. 
Rsync is definitely more appropriate.

The thing I needed in particular was to be able to pass build settings to xcodebuild that I 
have set in the XCode project and that we use in dependent projects (e.g. -sdk macosx10.5, etc).

Added a gemspec so I can publish it from github, allowing us here at zetetic to use it specifically.

== DESCRIPTION:

Build and deploy tools for Cocoa apps using Sparkle for distributions and upgrades; 
itâ€™s like Hoe but for Cocoa apps.

Package up your OS X/Cocoa applications into Custom DMGs, generate Sparkle XML, and
upload. Instead of hours, its only 30 seconds to release each new version of an application.

Build and deploy tools for Cocoa apps using Sparkle for distributions and upgrades; it's
like Hoe but for Cocoa apps.

The main feature is a powerful rake task "rake appcast" which builds a release of your
application, creates a DMG package, generates a Sparkle XML file, and posts the package
and XML file to your remote host via rsync.

All rake tasks:

    rake appcast         # Create dmg, update appcast file, and upload to host
    rake build   # Build Xcode Release
    rake dmg     # Create the dmg file for appcasting
    rake feed    # Create/update the appcast file
    rake upload  # Upload the appcast file to the host

== Why is it called 'ChocTop'? 

In Australia, Choc-Tops are ice cream cones, with hardened chocolate on top, 
normally served at the movie cinemas. When we (http://mocra.com) were brainstorming a name for this
project we combined "Sparkle" + "Cocoa" + "it's almost lunch time and we're hungry" to remember 
the wonderful Choc-Top ice creams. MMmmm.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

ChocTop comes with rake tasks to instantly deploy your latest Cocoa app's version
to a remote host, instantly activating all your users' Sparkle auto-updates.

* builds a Release of your project from your Xcode project (via xcodebuild tool)
* packages a DMG of your released app using Info.plist configuration (rake dmg)
* generates Sparkle-formatted XML file
* uploads the DMG and XML files to a remote host

== SYNOPSIS:

  cd to/my/cocoa/app
  install_choctop .
  
Alternately, if you already have a Rakefile in your Xcode project, then add the following
to the end:

    require "choctop"

    ChocTop.new do |s|
      s.remote_dir = '/path/to/upload/root/of/app'
      
      # Optional, showing defaults
      s.host          = host from Info.plist['SUFeedURL']
      s.base_url      = "http://#{s.host}"
      s.release_notes = "release_notes.html"
      
      # Custom DMG
      s.background_file = "background.jpg"
      s.app_icon_position = [100, 90]
      s.applications_icon_position =  [400, 90]
      s.applications_icon =  "applications.icns"
      
      # Extra files
      s.add_file 'path/to/README.txt', :position => [250, 90]
      s.file :target_bundle, :position => [50, 100]
      s.file proc { 'README.txt' }, :position => [50, 100]
      s.file :position => [50, 100] { 'README.txt' }
      
      # Custom DMG options
      s.volume_icon = "dmg.icns"
      s.icon_size = 104
    end

In your Rakefile, update the ChocTop configuration with the host and remote_dir details.
The rake tasks use rsync to upload the files, so ensure that you have ssh access to the
remote server, with a password/ssh keys.

Also, in your project's Info.plist, remember to update/add the following keys:

    CFBundleExecutable - name of your project
    CFBundleVersion - version for next release, using X.Y.Z format
    SUFeedURL - url to Sparkle URL (future: insert this automatically)

The create the distribution, Sparkle XML file, and upload it to the remote host:

  rake appcast

The build process uses your Xcode project file, via the xcodebuild command. If this fails,
you may need to run the build process manually via Xcode. Set Configuration to Release (normally
its set to Debug for development) and then Build. The "rake appcast" task should finish to completion.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* RubyCocoa (installed with OS X 10.5 Leopard)
