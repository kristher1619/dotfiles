# PeepOpen

A fuzzy file finder for your text editor.

Originally a commercial product at PeepCode (recently acquired by [Pluralsight](https://pluralsight.com)). Now open sourced.

## Download

Get the app at the [download page](http://topfunky.github.io/PeepOpen/).

## Usage/Build

Coming soon. Currently depends on an older BWToolkit plugin that uses Xcode 3. Needs to be upgraded or refactored to work with latest Xcode.

## Contribute

I'm operating with a freely flowing commit bit. Ask and I'm glad to add you to the project.

## Dependencies

Needs Sparkle, MacRuby and some other things. Documentation coming soon.
